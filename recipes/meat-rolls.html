    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>100 g / 3½ oz. pork fat or fatty bacon</li>
        <li>100 g / 3½ oz. pork fat or fatty bacon</li>
        <li>a pinch of thyme</li>
        <li>10-12 sprigs of fresh dill</li>
        <li>50 g / ⅓ cup flour</li>
        <li>50 g / ¼ cup semolina</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>salt, pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the pork loin into portion-sized pieces. 
            Cover with plastic wrap and pound each piece until tender. 
            Rub it with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix small pieces of pork fat or fatty bacon with finely chopped garlic and dill. 
            Add thyme and blend in a food processor until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Form the fat-and-herbs mass into logs, place each in the center of a pork loin piece, 
            leaving room on the sides, then roll up. 
            Secure each roll with a toothpick.
        </li>
        <li>
            On to the two-step coating process. Coat each meat roll in flour, 
            then dip into egg wash, and then sprinkle with semolina.
        </li>
        <li>Place the rolls on a hot oiled pan and fry for several minutes until golden brown on all sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Move the rolls to a roasting tray lined with baking paper and roast for 15 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
